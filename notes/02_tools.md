### 3. The Command Line

--

* like the Chrome Developer Console, but for your computer!
--

* you can do anything on your computer through the console
--

    * add, remove, edit, copy, and move files and folders
    * open and close applications
    * move the mouse, take screenshots, change the volume
    * make your computer talk!
--

We need it because programs made for programmers usually don't have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that you can click.
